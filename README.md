# Code Review

In the following block of code, we are doing the automation of the power plug by 3 conditions:
* Temperature - The temperature is in cÂ°
* Light - The light sensetivity is between 1 to 1023.
* Motion - 0 for no movment, 1 for movment
```C++
 if (Temp > /*wanted temperature*/){               
    if(Light > /*wanted light sensetivity*/){   
      if(Motion == /*0 OR 1*/){  
        digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW);    //disable the power socket
      }
    }
  }
  else
    digitalWrite(relayPin, HIGH);
```


In the next block of code, we can
